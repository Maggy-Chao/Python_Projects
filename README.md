# Python_Projects
This repository contains a collection of data science and analytics projects that I have developed.
Each project demonstrates practical Data Mining and Machine Learning applications using Python, SQL and relevant libraries.
These include:
1. Disease Risk Prediction: Built predictive models to forecast disease risks using classification algorithms and clustering techniques
2. Customer Segmentation & Retention Strategy: Applied RFM analysis and DBSCAN clustering to identify customer groups and optimise marketing efforts
3. Web and Social Media Text Mining: Used NLP and text mining to analyse social media discussions, uncover user sentiments, and identify key themes and trends related to specific topics
