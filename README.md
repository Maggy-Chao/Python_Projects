# Python_Projects
This repository contains a collection of Data Sciene and analytics projects I have developed
Each project demonstrates practical applications of Data Mining and Machine Learning using Pythin, SQL and relevant libraries
These include:
1. Disease Risk Prediction: Built predictive models to forecast disease risks using classification algorithms and clustering techniques
2. Customer Segmentation & Retention Strategy: Applied RFM analysis and DBSCAN clustering to identify customer groups and optimize marketing efforts
3. Web and Social Media Text Mining: Used NLP and text mining to analyze social media discussions, uncover user sentiments, and identify key themes and trends related to specific topics
